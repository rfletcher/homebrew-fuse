# Homebrew Fuse

These Formulae have a hard requirement on [Fuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace).

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap homebrew/fuse` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/fuse/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-fuse/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Acceptable Formulae.

You can read Homebrew’s Acceptable Formulae document [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Acceptable-Formulae.md).

## Troubleshooting
First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md).

**If you don’t read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**
